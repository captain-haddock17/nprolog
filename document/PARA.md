# Invoke

npl -n on child machine terminal. N-Prolog runs with network mode.

N-Prolog on parent machine terminal. and dp_create/1 to establish TCP/IP between child Prolog.

# Spec

    npl -n: Launches child Prolog in network mode with the -n option.

    dp_create([IP0,IP1, â€¦,IPn]): Provides IP addresse of child machines to establish TCP/IP communication with the parent Lisp. IP addresse is provided as atom. e.g. '178.1.166.2'

    dp-and([p0,p1, ...,pn]): It executes the predicates from P0 to PN in parallel. If all of them return YES, it returns YES. If even one returns NO, it returns NO.

    dp_or([p0,p1, ...,n]): It executes the predicates from P0 to PN in parallel. If any one of them returns YES, it interrupts the other computations and returns YES.

    dp_transfer(Fn): Transfers file Fn to all child machines from the parent machine.

    dp_compile(Fn): Compiles file Fn on both parent and child machines.

    dp_consult(Fn): Loads file Fn on both parent and child machines.

    dp_prove(Nth,Pred): Prove Predicate on the Nth child Prolog for testing.

    dp_report(Str): Display String on parent terminal.

    dp_close: Sends termination command to child machines and closes communication.


# Example

```
qsort([], []). 
qsort([Pivot|Tail], Sorted) :-
    partition(Pivot, Tail, Left, Right),
    dp_and([qsort(Left, LeftSorted),qsort(Right, RightSorted)]),   
    append(LeftSorted, [Pivot|RightSorted], Sorted). 

?- dp_create(['178.1.166.1','178.1.166.2']).
?- dp_transfer('./tests/qsort.pl').
?- dp_compile('./tests/qsort.pl').
?- dp_consult('./tests/qsort.o').
?- qsort([2,3,1],X).
 X = [1,2,3] 

?- dp_close.
```

The aforementioned qsort example is intended to illustrate the mechanism, not as a practical example, because the overhead is large compared to the small computational cost. The use case for dp_and/1 is better suited for larger, time-consuming computations that can be computed in parallel independently.

The use case for dp_or/1 is when not all computations are necessarily required. For example, it can be used in determining whether a large number is prime or a pseudoprime. If a single prime factor is found, it is immediately clear that the number is composite, and the remaining computations are unnecessary. This is the kind of situation where dp_or/1 is useful.

The parallel functionality provided by N-Prolog is simple and clear. By isolating and executing large, parallelizable computations within the scope of Prolog's syntax, it aims to dramatically increase the computational capacity of Prolog.

# Protocol
The parent process converts predicates into strings and sends them via TCP/IP communication to the child process. The child process converts the strings back into predicates and attempts to prove them. During this process, variable names are renamed. In the parent process, intermediate calculation variables are represented as v_1, for example. By interpreting these as uppercase V_1, they can be handled as standard variables in Prolog.

At the end of the proof, the child process returns the result as a conjunction or predicate. In the case of success, it returns the unification information of the variables along with the final result true as a conjunction. For example, V_1=2,true. is returned. In the case of failure, it returns fail. These results are sent back to the parent process as strings. The parent process converts these strings back into predicates and transforms the variable V1 into v_1 or the original intermediate variable. By processing this as a proof sequence, the parent process performs unification for the intermediate variables.

In N-Prolog, the predicate ask/0, which is used internally, is appended at the end of the proof sequence. When the child process is operating in network mode, it modifies the behavior of ask/0. Specifically, it converts the unification information of variables and the proof result into a conjunction. For example, it generates V1=2,true.. The child process then further converts this into a string and sends it to the parent process via TCP/IP.

The child process can receive instructions from the parent process via a thread during the proof process. The commands are as follows: 0x11 for stop, 0x12 for pause, and 0x13 for resume. When the child process starts in network mode, it initializes this thread in advance.

The parent process sends the atom 'end_of_file' to each child process to terminate the network mode.

Communication between the parent and child processes is conducted via a buffer called bridge. Predicates are converted into strings and transmitted over TCP/IP. The receiving side converts these strings back into predicates and executes them. The functionality of string_term/2 is utilized for this purpose.
